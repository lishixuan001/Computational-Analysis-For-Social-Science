Log Records for N-Gram Team
=========================================================

### 9/25 ###
Updated filtering constraints. Now enables: 
- Create DataFrames for ngram1, ngram2, ngram3
- Filter out entry begins/ends with a number
- Filter out entry is a single letter (unigram only)

### Plans ###
- Change a bug that 2-grams also filters out single letter words
- Writes specifically for ngram3 (now combined with ngram2)
- Make ngram DataFrames formatted and be prepared for matching trials
